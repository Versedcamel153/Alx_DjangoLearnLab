# Permissions Setup

## Custom Permissions
- **can_view**: Allows viewing of instances.
- **can_create**: Allows creation of new instances.
- **can_edit**: Allows editing of instances.

## Enforcing Permissions
Permissions are enforced in views using Django’s `@permission_required` decorator. Ensure that the correct permission is checked before allowing access to any restricted action.

# Security Settings

# CSRF Protection

All forms include `{% csrf_token %}` to prevent CSRF attacks.
